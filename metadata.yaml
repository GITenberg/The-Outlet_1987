description: The Civil War changed the contours of the United States in countless
  ways -- including the business landscape. In the aftermath of the conflict, Texas
  cattle companies began trading their livestock with buyers in the Pacific Northwest.
  The Outlet is a gripping account of the first grueling cattle drives to the region
  -- and the indefatigable ranchers and laborers who brought this long-deferred dream
  to fruition.
